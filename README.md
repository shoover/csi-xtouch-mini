A [Reaper CSI](https://github.com/GeoffAWaddington/CSI30Wiki/wiki) surface and
zones for the Behringer X-TOUCH MINI.

Zone summary:
- Home zone is generally based on standard MC zones.
- Auto-activate MC mode in the controller when loading the home zone.
  Auto-activate standard mode on exit doesn't work, but you can force it: hold
  the MC button.
- S-GEAR 3 FX params (mapped completely idiosyncratically to match my S-GEAR
  standalone MIDI mappings).
- Global tempo change subzone.

To install, follow the instructions in the CSI wiki but replace the files in
%APPDATA%\CSI (Windows) with a clone of the repo.
